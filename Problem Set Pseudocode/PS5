HAM-PATH(G,u,v):
# for each possible permutation of vertices in G, - O(n)
    # make a path using that list of vertices - O(1)
    # verify no repeat edges exist - O(1)
    # verify path length has the same number of vertices as G - O(1)
    # verify each vertex pair has an edge connecting them in G - O(n)
    # verify path starts at u and ends at v - O(1)
    # if all conditions are satisfied, output is true - O(1)
    # else output is false - O(1)
# return the result

possible runtime of the above algorithm is O(n^2).

if the verification algorithm is comparing a correct hamiltonian path to
each certificate output of HAM-PATH, and each execution of HAM-PATH takes
polynomial time, then the language HAM-PATH belongs to NP.
